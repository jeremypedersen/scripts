# Scripts

This is where I park handy little scripts I use to do things like:

- Convert images between formats, while preserving metadata
- Compress video
- Extract audio from video files
- Batch rename images and video files

And lots more. Scripts are sorted based on the language used. For instance bash shell scripts (which should generally work on both macOS and Linux) are in `bash`, while Windows scripts are in `powershell`.
